                <hr>
                <p>No doubt plastics are harmful, not only for the health of humans but also for biodiversity. By reducing the amount of
                plastic you use (especially that you dispose of), will go a long way to helping out.
                <br>
                <br>
                Considering the abundance of plastic in our lives, the task seems enormous. But, some small steps can considerably
                decrease the amount of plastic that we use every day.
                <br>
                <br>
                sing a recyclable cloth bag
                Using refillable glass, clay, stainless steel, or copper bottles instead of plastic
                Replace your plastic straws with reusable steel or paper ones
                Shop with stores and brands that use non-plastic packaging
                Always ask for a reusable or non-plastic option when shopping or getting take away. 
                <br>
                <br>
                The more people request re-usable
                containers, the more companies and businesses will get the idea that they need to supply them.
                <br>
                <br>
                <strong>Replacing fossil fuels with sustainable and renewable energy</strong> is always a good idea in this day and age. The use of solar
                panels, for example, would save thousands of megawatts of electricity if lots of people adopted it.
                <br>
                <br>
                <strong>Setting up rooftop solar panels</strong> can be expensive. But with the advancements in technology, solar is becoming more
                efficient while the costs of installation are going down. Check out whether you can sell your excess power back to the
                grid and make some money meanwhile too perhaps.
                <br>

            <strong>Public transportation</strong> not only provides a way to reduce pollution in cities, but it could also allow you to meet
            new people on your journey. It also aids in reducing the traffic congestion on the streets, which in turn further
            reduces the pollution from cars idling, and could allow everyone to reach their destinations faster.
