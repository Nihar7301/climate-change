                <h2>CAUSES OF CLIMATE CHANGE</h2>
                <hr>
                <p>The main driver of climate change is the greenhouse effect. Some gases in the Earth's atmosphere act a bit like the
                glass in a greenhouse, trapping the sun's heat and stopping it from leaking back into space and causing global warming.
            CO2 produced by human activities is the largest contributor to global warming. By 2020, its concentration in the
            atmosphere had risen to 48% above its pre-industrial level (before 1750).
            <br>
            <br>
            Other greenhouse gases are emitted by human activity in smaller quantities. Methane is a more powerful greenhouse gas
            than CO2, but has a shorter atmospheric lifetime. Nitrous oxide, like CO2, is a long-lived greenhouse gas that
            accumulates in the atmosphere over decades to centuries.
            <br>
            <br>
            Burning coal, oil and gas produces carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide.
            Cutting down forests (deforestation). Trees help to regulate the climate by absorbing CO2 from the atmosphere. When they
            are cut down, that beneficial effect is lost and the carbon stored in the trees is released into the atmosphere, adding
            to the greenhouse effect.
            <br>
            <br>
            Increasing livestock farming. Cows and sheep produce large amounts of methane when they digest their food.
            Fertilisers containing nitrogen produce nitrous oxide emissions.
            Fluorinated gases are emitted from equipment and products that use these gases. Such emissions have a very strong
            warming effect, up to 23 000 times greater than CO2.
            <br>
            <br>
            2011-2020 was the warmest decade recorded, with global average temperature reaching 1.1°C above pre-industrial levels in
            2019. Human-induced global warming is presently increasing at a rate of 0.2°C per decade.
            <br>
            <br>
            An increase of 2°C compared to the temperature in pre-industrial times is associated with serious negative impacts on to
            the natural environment and human health and wellbeing, including a much higher risk that dangerous and possibly
            catastrophic changes in the global environment will occur.
            <br>
            <br>
            For this reason, the international community has recognised the need to keep warming well below 2°C and pursue efforts
            to limit it to 1.5°C.
