                <h2>WHAT IS CLIMATE CHANGE? IS IT REALLY HAPPENING?</h2>
                <p>Climate change is a change in the usual weather found in a place. This could be a change in how much rain a place
                usually gets in a year. Or it could be a change in a place's usual temperature for a month or season.
                
                Climate change is also a change in Earth's climate. This could be a change in Earth's usual temperature. Or it could be
                a change in where rain and snow usually fall on Earth.
                
                Weather can change in just a few hours. Climate takes hundreds or even millions of years to change.
</p>
<br>

<p>
    Earth's climate is always changing. There have been times when Earth's climate has been warmer than it is now. There
    have been times when it has been cooler. These times can last thousands or millions of years.
    
    People who study Earth see that Earth's climate is getting warmer. Earth's temperature has gone up about one degree
    Fahrenheit in the last 100 years. This may not seem like much. But small changes in Earth's temperature can have big
    effects.
    
    Some effects are already happening. Warming of Earth's climate has caused some snow and ice to melt. The warming also
    has caused oceans to rise. And it has changed the timing of when certain plants grow.
</p>
<br>

<p>
    Climate is sometimes mistaken for weather. But climate is different from weather because it is measured over a long
    period of time, whereas weather can change from day to day, or from year to year. The climate of an area includes
    seasonal temperature and rainfall averages, and wind patterns. Different places have different climates.
    <br>
    <br>
    A desert, for
    example, is referred to as an arid climate because little water falls, as rain or snow, during the year. Other types of
    climate include tropical climates, which are hot and humid, and temperate climates, which have warm summers and cooler
    winters.
    <br>
    <br>
    Climate change is the long-term alteration of temperature and typical weather patterns in a place. Climate change could
    refer to a particular location or the planet as a whole. Climate change may cause weather patterns to be less
    predictable. 
    <br>
    <br>
    These unexpected weather patterns can make it difficult to maintain and grow crops in regions that rely on
    farming because expected temperature and rainfall levels can no longer be relied on. Climate change has also been
    connected with other damaging weather events such as more frequent and more intense hurricanes, floods, downpours, and
    winter storms.
<br>
<br>
In polar regions, the warming global temperatures associated with climate change have meant ice sheets and glaciers are
melting at an accelerated rate from season to season. This contributes to sea levels rising in different regions of the
planet. Together with expanding ocean waters due to rising temperatures, the resulting rise in sea level has begun to
damage coastlines as a result of increased flooding and erosion.
